# Introduction

The main reading for this unit is the [chapter](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) Object Oriented Programming from [A byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/).

If you want to expand, the [chapter](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/iterators.html) about Iterators and Classes from [Dive into Python 3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/) is pretty good, but the "Iterators" part can confuse you. It's actually a topic in which we spend a few weeks during the [Advanced Python](https://rmotr.com/advanced-python-programming) course.
